### Practice Overview

You will analyze the component structure of a legacy, class-based component during this lesson. Then you will convert that class-based component into a functional component that uses hooks.

### Steps:

1. Setup:

   - `cd lesson-8.9-class-based-components/practice`
   - `npm install`
   - `npm start`
   - open a browser window and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`

2. Familiarize yourself with the app and file structure. Then open <ClassBasedForm/> within the components directory.

3. Answer the short answer questions about class based components before moving on to step 4.
